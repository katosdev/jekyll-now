# Changes to Creators Wave.
Greetings all! 
We at Creators Wave have decided to introduce this blog as a way to update users with changes and news. This place will also host our status updates for when we have system outages. We are currently hosting this on Github Pages, but in the future will aim to move this to a different host for greater control, and to simplify our workflow.

By hosting on Github, we are able to ensure that the page will be available, even if our servers go offline. This means that we can continue to provide our users with updates as part of our transparency beliefs.
